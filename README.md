# What?
This is the react frontend for a collection of games I am creating.

# Games

## Pick A President
You are given a random quotation.  Can you identify which of 4 U.S. Presidents said it?

# About
Just a react app.  Clone the project, use npm start to get it running.  By default it will try to call the games-service on localhost:8000.  If you don't have that service running locally you can point it at the official service (location TBD).
